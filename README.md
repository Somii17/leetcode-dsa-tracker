# 💻 Somya's LeetCode Journey

Hey there! I'm Somya, a final-year BTech student trying to turn my zero into something solid.  
This repo is where I’m documenting my progress solving DSA problems from LeetCode — one day, one problem, one step at a time. 🧠✨

I started this journey because I want to:
- Build real confidence in problem-solving
- Crack coding interviews & get placed as an SDE
- Prove to myself that it's never too late to start
